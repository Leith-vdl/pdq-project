<h1>800 Intranet Product Render</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b>
<br>
A first protottype of the UK Bank Holidays app, it uses PDQ to render a table with holiday dates, and a radio button to switch between countries. Similar the final version of the app, it filters out older holidays, only presenting the user with dates still to come. 
<br>
While this version of the app is quite rudimentary, it served as a good first look into PDQ, and was built upon to create the final production version
